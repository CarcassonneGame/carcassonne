## Objective 🎯
Claim cities, roads, fields, and monasteries to become the ruler of the land.

## Components 🧱
- A large flat area to build the game board.
- A set of 72 terrain tiles with various features (cities, roads, fields, and monasteries).
- A scoring track.
- 40 followers, 8 🔴 8 🔵 8 🟢 8 🟡 8 🟣.
- A starting tile (with a different back).

## Setting Up 🏗️
1. Place the starting tile face-up in the center of the game area.
2. Shuffle the remaining terrain tiles face down.
3. Each player selects a color and takes their set of followers.
4. Place all players' followers on the '0' space of the scoring track.
5. The youngest player goes first and play continues clockwise around the board.

## How to Play 🚀
What to do on your turn:

1. **Draw and Place a Tile:** On your turn, draw a terrain tile and add it to the existing landscape by matching its features to those on adjacent tiles. Tiles must be placed orthogonally (not diagonally), and they must align correctly with the existing features (roads must connect to roads, cities to cities, etc.).

2. **Optional: Place a Follower:** After placing a tile, you may choose to place one of your followers on the tile you just placed. You may not place a follower on a road, in a city or in a field if that section is connected to another tile where there already is a follower. 
   - **City:** Place a follower in a city segment to claim it. Cities are completed when they are completely surrounded by walls.
   - **Road:** Place a follower on a road segment to claim it. Roads are completed when they are completed and reach two endpoints (cities or crossings).
   - **Field:** Place a follower as a farmer in a field. Farmers score points at the end of the game based on the number of completed cities adjacent to their fields.
   - **Monastery:** Place a follower as a monk in a monastery. Monasteries are completed when they are completely surrounded by 8 tiles.

3. **Score Completed Features:** Whenever a feature (city, road, or monastery) is completed, it is scored immediately and the follower(s) are returned to the player(s): 
   - **City:** The player with the most followers in the completed city scores 2 points per tile in the city, plus 2 points for each pennant in the city. If multiple players tie with the most followers, they all score.
   - **Road:** The player with the most followers on the completed road scores 1 point per tile in the road. Ties also score.
   - **Monastery:** The player who owns the follower on the completed monastery scores 9 points.

4. **Retrieve Followers:** After scoring, return your follower(s) from the completed feature(s) to your supply.

5. **Draw a New Tile:** Finish your turn by drawing a new terrain tile.

## How to Win 🏆
The game ends when all terrain tiles have been placed. At this point, final scoring occurs:
- Score any remaining cities and roads. Each claimed but incomplete city or road segement counts as 1 point. City pennants count for an additional 1 point.
- The player with the most farmers in a field wins the field. Award 3 points for each completed city adjacent to the claimed fields. Note that several fields can supply a single city in which case the player with the most farmers in the fields adjacent to the city wins the points for that city.
- The player with the most points wins.
